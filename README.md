<h1>SUBMISSION OF EVERGREEN CLASSIFICATION CHALLENGE</h1>
<p1>The goal of our project was to study a
specific instance of this broad and vital web
classification problem and developing a
successful prediction system. We selected
the StumbleUpon Evergreen Classification
Challenge, that requires building a classifier
to categorize webpages as evergreen or
ephemeral. Most news articles or seasonal
recipes are relevant for only a short period of
time while others are relevant forever and
can be recommended to users anytime.
Therefore, based on the relevancy of a
webpage, it can be classified as “evergreen”
or “non-evergreen”.</p>
